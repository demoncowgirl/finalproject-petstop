Pet Stop
A one-stop-shop providing handy resources for pet-lovers. The site will focus on presenting available adoption searches, based on input and user profiles,

My intention is to also provide pages for users to search for local veterinary services, kennels, groomers, pet sitters/walkers, emergency animal services, humane societies and pet rescues and local pet retailers. I would also like to make queried reports available and a page where users can leave starred reviews for any of the available resources and businesses.
